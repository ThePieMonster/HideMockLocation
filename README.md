## Summary
![Logo](app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

Hide Mock Location is an Xposed Module (now LSPosed on Android 11), which hides information about the 'Allow mock locations' setting.

## Usage
* Install [module](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.github.thepiemonster.hidemocklocation) from [LSPosed module store](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed).
* Enable module in LSPosed (select System Framework) and reboot device.
* Start a mock location provider application such as [Fake GPS Location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en_US&gl=US).
* That's it! You can open Hide Mock Location and view the "Test Location Data" page to view the status of the mock location setting.

## Tips
* You can view the "Test Location Data" page without enabling the module in LSPosed.
* Try enabling a mock location application before and after enabling the LSPosed module to view different output settings.
